AUDIOMETER

Using the mpv player powered by the FFmpeg libraries (see elsewhere in my respositories or in the Internet), Audiometer.py
creates an on-screen set of meters to show you much information about a stereo audio signal.

This program works not only on files, but also on Internet streams: anything that the mpv player (and, therefore, FFmpeg) can read.

Make sure your Fontconfig cache is up to date: run fc-cache at some point (and, on Windows, this must be as Administrator).

The PPM is calibrated to BBC on-line standards.
